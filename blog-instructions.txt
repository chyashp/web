   - 5-7 H2 sections covering different aspects of the topic
   - H3 subsections where appropriate
   - "key takeaways" section at the end
   - Custom CTA that relates to the article topic

## SEO REQUIREMENTS

1. **Keywords**:

   - Focus on long-tail technical keywords (3-5 words)

2. **Links**:
   - Include 3-7 external links to authoritative sources (React docs, MDN, engineering blogs)

   - Focus on actionable advice backed by code examples
   - Include implementation details, not just theory

## CODE SNIPPETS

1. **Format**:
   - Use triple backticks with language specification

   - Include explanatory comments

2. **Content**:
   - Show real-world implementation examples
   - Include both "before" and "after" examples when discussing optimization
   - Focus on production-ready patterns, not just concepts

## STYLE GUIDE

1. **Voice & Tone**:
   - Expert but accessible
   - Direct and practical
   - Use "you" to address the reader
   - Assume intermediate technical knowledge

2. **Formatting**:
   - Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
